# My Personal Project for CPSC 210

## Opportunities Management System

### **Task 2**

> **_Opportunities Management System_** is for students looking for off-campus
> opportunities or wanting to create opportunities for others. It facilitates adding
> information about students, their projects, internships and volunteering opportunities. 
> Users can find requirements, deadlines for opportunities, partners for projects
> and number of positions available for a certain opportunity. Aside from this, 
> students are able to filter out opportunities according to their interests. 
> I became interested to embark on this project since I am immensely interested 
> in EdTech and Career Guidance Counselling for high school students. I believe that, 
> with more open-source opportunities, students - be they undergraduates or high school 
> students - will be able to concentrate on their interests and apply for opportunities, 
> thus contributing positively to their career journeys.
